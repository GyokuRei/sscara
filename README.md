# sscara
Small size 3d printer with SCARA based mechanics

Current Status: V2 - WIP (a lot of improvements on the way)

Details:
* x8 or x9 gear ratio (current is 5, with x8 precision will increased in 1.6)
* Belt path will be shortened twice (no belt couplers at all, less stetch errors)
* No teeth on big pulleys at all (more precision, easy to print).
* Smaller dimensions (but with the same print area).
* A lot of improvements - more modular and service friendly
* Z axis will be improved (at least 2 bearing for each rod and may be threaded rod, more modular way to attach - currently it is hard to upgrade without disassembly)

History:
* 28.07.2015 - V2 - WIP
* 27.07.2015 - V1 - DONE
* 27.04.2015 - V1 - WIP

Dimensions: 
* Base footprint - 165x140mm, height - 330mm

Printing Area:
* 100x120x120mm

Mass:
* ~2.5 kg (looks like 3kg max)

Precision:
WIP
XY: 0.03 mm with 32 microsteps at 150 mm radius from axes center. (chord length c=2*R*sin(alpha/2), alpha = 1.8/5/32 (stepper/gearratio/nummicrosteps);
Z: GT2 16 teeth pulley with 32 microsteps - 5 Î¼m (http://reprap.org/wiki/Step_rates)
 
Other features:
* Noiseless

Hardware: 
* 4 Nema17 (24mm length shaft)
* Ramps 1.4
* 4 drv8825 (drv8825 is better due to 1/32 microstepping)
* External power supply 5A (without Heated bed)
* Heated bed ????? depends on (but seems like require in 4x time less current than MK2B - because of 4 times lower area)
* 3 small (20x11x7mm) end stoppers
Optional:
* HC-05 bluetooth module (i am happy with it, even firmware flashing done via bluetooth)

Firmware:
* Marlin (modified)
** FIVE_BAR define added for SCARA define
** added M450 - xyz min limits
** added M451 - xyz max limits
** added M452 - xyz home pos
** added M370 X#Angle Y#Angle
** G2/G3 commands support
** Fixed math for pure SCARA (2 arms)

Materials:
* ~1.5 meters(2m max) - GT2 timing belt 6mm(width)
* 3 - GT2 16 teeth pulleys (ID=5mm)
* 4 - Nema17 (24mm shaft length) (39 mm Nema17 might be used for xy)
* 4 - 625 bearings (ID-5mm,OD-16mm,H-5mm)
* 2 - 608 bearings (ID-8mm,OD-22mm,H-7mm)
* 21 - 623 bearings (ID-3mm,OD-10mm,H-4mm)
* 1 - aluminium tube (ID-6mm,OD-8mm) - 350mm max
* 1 - m5 threaded rod - 500mm max
* 1 - m3 threaded rod - 2 meters max
* m3 bolts and nuts
* m5 nuts
* ABS filament to print parts


SCAD:
* use drawArray = [] to draw everything or drawArray=[1,2,3] for parts
* use printLayout to control parts/subparts layout (0 for design, 1 for export) (Some parts need to be rotated to 180 Y) (WIP)
* isExpolode - variable to control explode mode view (WIP)
* NemaSize - tweak nema len, NemaLengthMedium,NemaLengthShort,NemaLengthLong

Slicer:
* Slic3r
* ABS - 0.4mm nozzle, setup is described in scad file for each part

Calibration Guide:
Enable EEPROM in you firmware.

XY calibration:

* G28 goto home
* Measure distance from nozzle to center (i.e. axis center)
* M450 X#xx Y#yy - where #xx and #yy is a measured distance from nozzle to the center (xx should negative)
* M452 X#xx Y#yy - where #xx and #yy is a measured distance from nozzle to the center (xx should negative)
* G28 goto home
* M500 to save data to EEPROM
NOTE2: home offset is an angles not a mm (also can be used for fine tuning - especially with M370 command, see Way2)
NOTE: it is possible to use use calibration plate from scad file (part #38 in stl folder)

Way2 (more precise):

* G28 goto home
* M452 X#xx Y#yy - where #xx and #yy is a measured distance from nozzle to the center (xx should negative, +/-1 mm is enought)
* G1 X## Y## (tweak X## and Y## to match angles for one arm to 0deg other to 180deg)
* M370 X45 Y135 // move arms to 45 and 135 degrees
* M206 X## Y## (where X## Y## is a angular distance to 45 and 135)
* Repeat a few times untill you get 45 and 135 degrees exactly (one arm shuld rotate from 0deg to 45deg, other from 180deg to 135deg)
* M500 to save data to EEPROM
NOTE: Steps per unit must me calibrated already
NOTE2: Home position calculation will use M206 offset angles to calculate real home pos


Steps Per Unit calibration:
Theory: stepperUnitsPerRevolution*driverMicrostepping*gearboxration/360, sscara (with drv8825 1/32) = 200*32*5/360 = 88.888
* G28 XY
* G1 X-50
* G1 X50
* Measure real distance and correct units (M92 X## Y##) until travel distance will become 100mm
* M500 to save data to EEPROM
NOTE2: home offset is an angles not a mm (also can be use for fine tuning calibration especially with M370 command)

Repeat XY and Units calibration a few times

Z calibration
* G28 Z
* G1 Z0
* M451 Z#zz+#ZZ where #zz is a distance beween nozzle and platform and #ZZ curent max distance
* M452 Z#zz+#ZZ where #zz is a distance beween nozzle and platform and #ZZ curent max distance
